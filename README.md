**Overview:**

One of the largest policy issues in international politics today is immigration. Throughout history, people have been displaced across the globe, all for a variety of reasons. To better understand this issue, one can look at the number of displaced people leaving countries all around the world, however, this data (which contains many levels of displacement information for 200 countries) can be quite difficult to observe and interpret. Our goal is to make this data more presentable and easy to digest.

This application contains three main ways to view the immigration data: a map to visually show displacement, a table to show the largest displacement events, and a graph to track displacement over time. Through the use of these tools, users will be able to better understand several things about immigration. They will be able to find out where people are going around the world, where they are coming from, immigration trends over time, and many other questions they might have while exploring the data. Specifically, the project aims to help people understand the issue who may be concerned about displaced person situations (just looking for knowledge about the topic), and possibly policy makers who are looking to look at hard data in a digestible way in order to better understand trends and changes in displaced persons' situations.

The data used in this application is from the United Nations Refugee Agency. UNHCR originally collected this data while helping on refugees, asylum-seekers, and people who are displaced since 1951. The data collects data based on about 200 countries both as destinations and origins for displaced people.

**Types of Displacement Glossary:**
- Asylum-seekers: Someone whose request for sanctuary has yet to be processed.

- Internally displaced persons: People who have not crossed a border to find safety.

- Refugees (incl. refugee-like situations): People fleeing conflict or persecution.

- Returned IDPs: Internally displaced persons who return to their areas of origin with the protection of UNHCR and assistance activities.

- Returnees: Displaced people returning home after time in exile.

- Stateless: People who are denied a nationality.

- Others of concern: Individuals who do not fall under any of the other groups, fall under UNHCR protection.
